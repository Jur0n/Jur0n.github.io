# Windows Server Update Service - WSUS

The Windows Server Update Service or short **WSUS** let the administrator download updates for specific programms and distributes the to the clients.
The Software which is distributed the most often consists of patches / security updates. Microsoft publishes them in regular periods to close known security risks.
To guarantee that this process is running without a huge effort, WSUS is used.

## Structure and Function of WSUS

The Windows Server Update Service is a Client-Server-System. The core softwarecomponent is a SQL Database that manages versiondata of updates and client-reports.
During a from the admin defined point of time the Server establishes a connection to the Microsoft-Update-Server ad downloads the necessary updates for its clients.
These are then provided through the local network for the clients. The clients decides when it asks for new updates, who asks for them regulary.
It can be set for important patches that they have to be downloaded until a certain date.
This central processed workflow brings many advantages to the adminitrator, p.e. that he does not have to update every client manually.
Updates can be processed and delivierd to groups. The whole clientconfiguration can be manages through **GPOS**.
The Service **BITS** - *Background Intelligent Transfer Service* is integrated into the Clients and transfers the updates to the clients when the network banthwith allows it. 
The usage of **WSUS** requires a consistent usage of the whole Microsoft-system. Special usecases are not easily automated and may require manual work.

## Installation of WSUS

The WSUS-Server is added as server-role through the server-manager.
