### Kick

#### EQ

Freq overview:
| Frequency | Character |
|---|---|
|40 to 60 hz|Bottom: Tone of reverberation|
|60 to 100 hz|Thump - air that is moving|
|100 to 200 hz| Body of the Kick|
|200 to 2000 hz|Hollowness, muddy or ringing sounds |
|2k to 4k|Beater - The Klick sound can be found here|

To Do:
- wide cut arround 280 hz to isolate the kickness (low freqs)
- Damp or boost the Klickness at around 3-4.5 kHz (personal taste)
- lcut at 40 possible

Example:

#### Dynamics

Gate:
- Attack needs to be as fast as possible, or it will take high end away
- set release time tight
- hold ~ 50ms

### Snare

#### EQ
Lcut to 120
mid range 415
boot high shelf ~18hz

"soft knee"
