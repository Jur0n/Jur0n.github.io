## Drums

General:

feel free to fine tune the Drum Gates at the end of the mix

### Kick

#### EQ

Freq overview:

|Frequency|Character|
|---|---|
|40 to 60 hz|Bottom: Tone of reverberation|
|60 to 100 hz|Thump - air that is moving|
|100 to 200 hz|Body of the Kick|
|200 to 2000 hz|Hollowness, muddy or ringing sounds |
|2k to 4k|Beater - The Klick sound can be found here|

To Do:
- wide cut arround 280 hz to isolate the kickness (low freqs)
- Damp or boost the Klickness at around 3-4.5 kHz (personal taste)
- lcut at 40 possible

Example:

![Kick-EQ](/img/audio/kick-eq.png "EQ for a Kick Drum")

#### Dynamics

Gate:
- Attack needs to be as fast as possible, or it will take high end away
- set release time tight
- hold ~ 50ms

### Snare Top

#### EQ

|Frequency|Character|
|---|---|
|200 to 400 hz|Body: Fundament of most snares|
|400 to 800 hz|Ring - hollow ringing|
|2k to 4k|Attack - Head of the Crack|
| 4k to ~ 8k|Sizzle and snap|

Lcut to 120
mid range 415
boot high shelf ~18hz

ToDo:
- cut arround 700hz
- Hshlv at top , 5 kHZ +

Example:

![snare-top-EQ](/img/audio/snare-top-eq.png "EQ for a Snare Top Mic")

#### Dynamics

Compression:
The Magic happens between the crack and the punch

- 4.0 Ratio
- Fast attack, 20 ms
- Hold 10 ms
- Release around 150 ms

#### FX

Reverb is crucial for a good snare sound
use Ambience Reverb:
- predelay: 14ms
- decay: ~2.00s
- size: 60
- Damping: 10kHz
- Diffuse: 30

Send to FX Channel -> about 3/7ths

---

### Snare Bot

Sound of the Fell.

#### EQ

ToDo:
- Cut low end
- Rest is same as top snare

Example:

![snare-bot-EQ](/img/audio/snare-bot-eq.png "EQ for a Snare bot Mic")

#### Dynamics

- strong ratio, 10
- fast attack
- hold as desired
- fast release, ~70ms

---

### Toms

#### EQ

|Frequency|Character|
|---|---|
|100 to 300 hz|Body: Depends on the drum itself, the "boom" sound is found here.|
|500 to 900 hz|Honk - buildup of unmusical tones, listen carefully|
|3k to 4k|Attack - Stick hitting the drum|

ToDo:
- wide cut around 300 hz
- boost hShlv at ~6k 

#### Gate
we want a snappy sound

- again, fast attack
- hold: ~150ms
- long release, ~650ms

### Cymbals, OHs. Hi-Hat

> "Hi-hat einfach muten" - Manuel Gottlieb

#### EQ

|Frequency|Character|
|---|---|
|200 to 300 hz|Clank: "chink" sound|
|6k and up|Sizzle - the "tsss" parts of cymbals, carefull tuning|



## Bass
---

#### EQ

-High Pass

#### Dynamics

Compression is key for a good bass sound.

## Piano
---
### Keys


### Pads


### Tracks

Should be fine, maybe a little trim and a HiPass Filter

---
## Akkoustic Guitar
---

#### EQ:
- Low-Cut bei ca 120Hz
- Midrange Oktaven verringern:
- 315Hz
- 630Hz
- 1.2 kHz

#### Dynamics 

"soft knee" 
Treshhold:	Not to low
Attack:	Fast - pick klick
Ratio:	
Release time:	Medium
Picking:        Faster Release
Strumming: Slower Release

Reverb ist  sinnvoll
