### Kick

#### EQ

Freq overview:
| Frequency | Character |
|---|---|
|40 to 60 hz|Bottom: Tone of reverberation|
|60 to 100 hz|Thump - air that is moving|
|100 to 200 hz| Body of the Kick|
|200 to 2000 hz|Hollowness, muddy or ringing sounds |
|2k to 4k|Beater - The Klick sound can be found here|

To Do:
- wide cut arround 280 hz to isolate the kickness (low freqs)
- Damp or boost the Klickness at around 3-4.5 kHz (personal taste)
- lcut at 40 possible

Example:

#### Dynamics

Gate:
- Attack needs to be as fast as possible, or it will take high end away
- set release time tight
- hold ~ 50ms

### Snare Top

#### EQ
Lcut to 120
mid range 415
boot high shelf ~18hz

ToDo:
- cut arroung 700hz
- Hshlv at top , 5 kHZ +

#### Dynamics

Compression:
You just want to get the punch

- 4.0 Ratio
- Fast attack, 20 ms
- Hold 10 ms
- Release around 150 ms

#### FX

Reverb is crucial for a good snare sound
use Ambience Reverb:
- predelay: 14ms
- decay: ~2.00s
- size: 60
- Damping: 10kHz
- Diffuse: 30

Send to FX Channel -> about 3/7ths

Equalizer:
- Low-Cut bei ca 120Hz
- Midrange Oktaven verringern:
- 315Hz
- 630Hz
- 1.2 kHz

Allgemein beachten
DÃ¼nn cutten - Breit boosten

Kompressor:

"soft knee" 
Treshhold:	Not to low
Attack:	Fast - pick klick
Ratio:	
Release time:	Medium
Picking:        Faster Release
Strumming: Slower Release

Reverb ist  sinnvoll
